# Signal analysis for line spectra signals

Various algorithms for spectral estimation of line spectra, such as
* MUltiple SIgnal Classification (**MUSIC**) method 
* Min Norm method
* Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rational Invariance Techniques (**ESPRIT**) method

Based on the book "Spectral Analysis of Signals", P. Stoica &amp; R. Moses

## Methods results

## Creating and running tests

To create your custom test, you can ```generate_signal``` and then ```apply_method``` from ```utils.py```.

To run any test simply go to the directory 'source' and type the following command in your terminal.

```
  python test.py
```
